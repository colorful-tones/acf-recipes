# ACF Recipes

Final demo site ðŸ‘‰ [acfrecipes.wpenine.com](https://acfrecipes.wpengine.com)

A demonstration of using [Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) to:

1. Create a custom post type: `Recipe`
2. Create a custom taxonomy: `Recipe Types` (e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner)
3. Create custom fields group: Cook & Prep Times
4. Create a custom [ACF Block](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/whats-new-with-acf-blocks-in-acf-6/): **Cook & Prep Times** that utilizes the custom fields and is available for the Recipe custom post type
    - Also, [register a custom block category](https://github.com/colorful-tones/acf-recipes/blob/main/plugins/acf-cooking-recipes/acf-cooking-recipes.php#L50): `Recipes` to put the Cook & Prep Times block under.
5. Create custom block patterns using WP Engine's [Pattern Manager](https://wpengine.com/builders/pattern-manager/)
    - Assign the block patterns to the Recipe post type
    - Make it available in the Recipe new post modal for editors
    - Register a custom block pattern category for Recipes

Includes:

- WP Engine's [Frost](https://frostwp.com) theme with patterns automatically generated and saved to the theme's `/patterns/` directory. Again, created with Pattern Manager, which also saves media (images) alongside each pattern within the theme!
  - [`themes/frost/patterns/recipe-full-page-columns.php`](https://github.com/colorful-tones/acf-recipes/blob/main/themes/frost-trunk/patterns/recipe-full-page-columns.php)
  - [`themes/frost/patterns/recipe-full-page-complex.php`](https://github.com/colorful-tones/acf-recipes/blob/main/themes/frost-trunk/patterns/recipe-full-page-complex.php)
